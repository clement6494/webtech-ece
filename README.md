# Web Technologies

Learn how to develop open-source, cross-platform server-side and networking applications with one of the most evolving and popular platforms, Node.js. Build a rich UI front-end to consume the REST and GraphQL API with React.js.

A web application is developed over the sources to illustrate the concepts of the course. The data storage layer uses an embedded NoSQL database. DevOps principles and tools including Git, unit tests, and CI/CD integration are covered. Most important, you will learn how to search, assess and integrate new ideas, libraries, and concepts from the Open Source community.
